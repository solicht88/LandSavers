# ðŸŒ± LandSavers  
LandSavers is an original 2-player pixel art game made with pygame.  
The goal of this project is to remind people of the importance of being sustainable in a fun way.  
A random fact and corresponding piece of advice related to sustainability is given each time the game ends.  
Project for Sprouthacks 2025, created by Amy (solicht88) and Sakina (sakikifz).  

## How to Play  
You and a friend are facing an ecological crisis and must restore sustainability in the Earth!  
The first player (the planter) must collect plant seeds, while the second player (the cleaner) collects plastic bottles.  
Both items will fall from the sky towards the player.  

**3 factors contribute to your score:**  
1. Catching the the right items will increase your score.  
2. Catching the other player's items will decrease your score.  
3. Missing a falling item will take away a life (start with 3).  
The percent rank is calculated based on the score out of 25.  

The score and lives are shared between the 2 players. Losing all your lives will end the game.  
Use A/D to move first player, and LEFT/RIGHT ARROW keys to move second player.  
Try to get the highest rank you can!
